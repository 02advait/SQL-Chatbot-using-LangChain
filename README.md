# SQL Chatbot using LangChain & Streamlit

🚀 A smart, conversational chatbot that lets you interact with your SQL database **using plain English** 
 — no SQL knowledge required!  
Built with **LangChain** for natural language processing, **Streamlit** for a sleek interface, and your favorite database as the backend.  

💡 Just ask a question like *"Show me the top 5 customers by sales"* and watch it instantly turn into SQL, execute it, and give you the results.
